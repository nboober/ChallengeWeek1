**Week One Challenge - Prime Numbers**

A prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and 1. 

This means that for each of the numbers from 2 to that number, the number cannot be divided without a remainder. 

For example, 9 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 3 without a remainder. But 7 is a prime number because it cannot be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 without a remainder. For further explanation, click here (Links to an external site.).

 

Write an application that will show the number and indicate whether or not it is prime. There are two ways that you can achieve this.

**Option 1:**

The user will have to input a number, and you will display that number. You will check if that number is prime and indicate that to the user. 

For example, if the user typed 10, it would display the following output: 


**10 is not a prime number**

**Option 2:**

Generate a random number between 1 and 250 (you can make this range larger if you'd like).  As with option 1, you will print the number and whether it is a prime number. You may consult the class repositories and use any of the two options we covered in class to generate a random number.

 

You can test to see whether a number is a prime number here (Links to an external site.). 

If you are not sure how to write the code but can write the pseudocode for it, start there, and save is as a .txt file that you can refer back to as you develop your program. Get the simple part working first, then add on  additional features.

 

Submit your assignment as a GitHub link.


-----------------------------------------------------

If you are finished with the above before 5pm, modify your program to give the user a choice to pick between option 1 and option 2 at the start of the program.

For example, the program should ask the user:

"Would you like to generate a random number? (Y/N)"

// if the user types "Y", proceed with option 2

"Generating a random number..."

// otherwise, if the user types "N", proceed with option 1

"Please enter a number: "
